The DeduplicateMessages module provides the ability to delete duplicate
messages as they arrive.  You may set the `duplicate-message-delay' variable to
determine how far apart, in seconds, duplicate messages must be before they're
ignored.  Setting this variable to a negative value will NOT prevent all
duplicate messages; at present it would be unwieldy to keep a cache of all
existant messages in perl, and check them against the current message.  You may
set the `duplicate-message-format' to any of the following values:

 * keep-first           Keep the first of a set of duplicate messages.
 * keep-first-and-last  Keep the first and last of a set of duplicate messages.
 * keep-last            Keep the last of a set of duplicate messages.
 * keep-all             Do not delete duplicate messages.  This is the default.

You must be using BarnOwl version 1.8 or later for this to module to work.

To use DeduplicateMessages, copy DedupliacteMessages.par into ~/.owl/modules.

Then, from BarnOwl, execute the ':reload-module DeduplicateMessages' command.
You may need to press 'o' twice to redraw existing messages.


Technical notes:
 * Duplicate messages still get logged, if you have logging turned on.
